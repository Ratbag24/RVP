"""Declarative base and the metadata naming convention.

The naming convention matters more than it looks. Postgres will invent names for
unnamed constraints and indexes, and Alembic then cannot refer to them in a
later migration without hardcoding whatever Postgres happened to pick. Fixing
the pattern up front means every constraint has a name we chose.
